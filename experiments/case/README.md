* Overview

 This is a test to see which is faster for handling `case` forms:

- an AVL tree (which is currently implemented).
- a linear scan of an array, with `array[n]` being the key and `array[n+1]` being the jump offset.

The 2nd item is actually similar to Clojure's maps (which, btw, makes me thing I may want to trie that for Digamma's).
