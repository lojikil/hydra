## Hydra: Stand Alone Complex ##

This is a "sub-repo" that is meant to be exclusively focused on getting Hydra sufficiently stand-alone. 
May not ever be main-lined, or anything.

## Includes ##

- Hydra (`hydra.ss`): the SAC version of Hydra
- Vesta (`vesta.c`, `vesta.h`): a modified version of Vesta's runtime
- MURTS (`murt.h`, `murt.ss`): micro-runtime system, what is shaping up to be vesta's replacement in the C backend
